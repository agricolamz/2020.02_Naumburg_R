# Data manipulation: `dplyr` {#dplyr}

First, load the library:

## Data

In this chapter we will use the following datasets.

### Misspelling dataset
This dataset I gathered after some manipulations with data from [The Gyllenhaal Experiment](https://pudding.cool/2019/02/gyllenhaal/) By Russell Goldenberg and Matt Daniels for [pudding](https://pudding.cool). They analysed mistakes in spellings of celebrities during the search.

```{r}
misspellings <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agricolamz/DS_for_DH/master/data/misspelling_dataset.csv")
```
  

```{r}
misspellings
```

There are the following variables in this dataset:

* `correct` --- correct spelling
* `spelling` --- user's spelling
* `count` --- number of cases of user's spelling

### `diamonds`

`diamonds` --- is the dataset built-in `tidyverse` package.

```{r}
diamonds
?diamonds
```
