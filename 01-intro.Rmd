# Introduction to R and RStudio {#intro}

## Introduction
### Why data science?
Data science is a new field that actively developing lately. This field merges computer science, math, statistics, and it is hard to say how much science in data science. In many scientific fields a new data science paradigm arises and even forms a new sub-field:

* Bioinformatics
* Crime data analysis
* Digital humanities
* Data journalism
* Data driven medicine
* ...

There are a lot of new books "Data Science for ...":

* psychologists [@hansjoerg19]

* public policy [@brooks13]
* fraud detection [@baesens15]
* ...

* create a statistical model based on data
* share and represent the results of this work
* organize the whole workflow in the reproducible way

### Why R?

R [@r19] is a programing language with a big infrastructure of packages that helps to work in different fields of science and computer technology.

There are several alternatives:

* Python [@vanderplas16; @grus19]
* bash [@janssens14]
