# Prerequisites

Before the classes I would like to ask you to follow the instructions mentioned below to prepare your device for the class work:

* install **R** from the following link: <https://cloud.r-project.org/>
* install **RStudio** from the following link: <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> (FREE version, no need to pay!)
* after the installation run the RStudio program, type `2+2`, and press `Enter`.

If you see something like this, then you are well prepared for classes.

* Go to the <https://rstudio.cloud/> website and sign up there. This is optional, but it will be a backup version, if something will not work on your computer.
